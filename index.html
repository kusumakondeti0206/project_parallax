        <p>
            <ul class="ul2">
                <li>Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on the weekends.</li>
                <li>Avoid nicotine and caffeine. Both are stimulants that keep you awake. Caffeine can take 6â€“8 hours to wear off completely.</li>
                <li>Limit electronics before bed. Try reading a book, listening to soothing music, or another relaxing activity instead.</li>
                <li>Create a good sleeping environment. Keep the temperature cool if possible. Get rid of sound and light distractions. Make it dark. Silence your cell phone.</li>
                <li>Avoid alcohol and large meals before bedtime. Both can prevent deep, restorative sleep.</li>

            Take a few slow, deep breaths until you feel your body un-clench a bit.
            Go for a walk, even if it's just to the restroom and back. It can give you a chance to think things through.
            Try a quick meditation or prayer to get some perspective.</p>
